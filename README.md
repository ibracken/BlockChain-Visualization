# Simple Blockchain in Go

This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Go. It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain, including block creation, proof of work, and chain management, with an easy-to-use command line interface (CLI).

## Features

- Create and add new blocks to the blockchain
- Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism for mining blocks
- Persistent storage of blockchain data using BoltDB
- Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the blockchain

## File Structure

```
simple_blockchain/
â”œâ”€â”€ blockchain/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Block.go                  # Defines the Block struct and related functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Blockchain.go             # Manages the blockchain and storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BlockchainIterator.go     # Allows traversal through the blockchain

```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.17 or later)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simple_blockchain
   ```

2. Initialize the Go module:

   ```sh
   go mod init simple_blockchain
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Running the Application

### Usage

The application is run from the command line. It accepts the following commands:

- **Add a Block**:

  ```sh
  go run main.go addblock -data "Your Block Data"
  ```

  This command will add a new block to the blockchain with the specified data.

- **Print the Blockchain**:

  ```sh
  go run main.go printchain
  ```

  This command will print all the blocks in the blockchain, showing their details.

### Example

1. **Adding a Block**

   ```sh
   go run main.go addblock -data "Hello Blockchain!"
   ```

   This will create a new block containing the message "Hello Blockchain!".

2. **Printing the Blockchain**

   ```sh
   go run main.go printchain
   ```

   This will display all blocks in the chain, including their data, hash, and previous hash.

## Concepts Covered

- **Block**: A unit in the blockchain that contains data, timestamp, and the hash of the previous block.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A consensus mechanism that secures the blockchain by requiring computational work to add a new block.
- **Persistence**: Blockchain data is stored using BoltDB, ensuring it is saved and retrievable.

## Project Structure Details

- **`Block.go`**: Defines the `Block` struct, which represents each block in the blockchain, and includes methods for creating a new block and computing its hash.
- **`Blockchain.go`**: Defines the `Blockchain` struct, which manages the chain of blocks and the database storage using BoltDB.
- **`CLI.go`**: Provides a command line interface to interact with the blockchain by allowing commands like `addblock` and `printchain`.
- **`ProofOfWork.go`**: Implements proof of work, securing the blockchain by making the creation of new blocks computationally expensive.

## Dependencies

- **BoltDB**: A fast key/value store for Go used to persist blockchain data.
